                    <p>Hi! As you've probably guessed by the name of the page, my name's Siana. I'm seriously passionate
                        about art - primarily photography and character design. I developed from doodles to bigger and
                        better art. I studied Level 2 Art and Design at Coleg Cambria in North Wales. I love video
                        games, particularly Vermintide, Minecraft and Paladins.</p><br>

                    <h3> About the Website </h3>

                    <p>This website is for sharing what I've made to anyone that's interested. I'm actively looking for
                        work, whether you're a company needing a character/graphic designer, or an individual wanting to
                        make a commision! Feel free to contact me using the form <a href="#contact-me-header" class="page-link">HERE! </a></p> <br><br>
