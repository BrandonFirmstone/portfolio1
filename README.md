# Siana's Gallery

This website was produced by myself for Siana Gilbertson, an artist wanting to expand their personal brand and reach. Siana's Gallery was designed based upon Siana's knowledge of the art community that they are a part of and is influenced by websites of other artists (these websites will be credited below)

## Design
### Desired Features
- Two galleries for showing Siana's Photography and Character Design separately
- Unique 'Splash Screen' style menu as a separate page incorporating Siana's art
- Contact page to allow people to contact Siana for collaboration, commisions and questions
- Footer with icons linking to Siana's social media

### Wireframe Designs
![Homescreen Design](./assets/images/home-screen-design.png "Home Screen Wire Frame")
- The boxes with crosses are images, specifically they are going to be characters designed by Siana. The design for these will be the characters falling from the sky.
- Each character will have text under it annotating what page it links to
- The sky will be the background of the image

![Contact Page Design](./assets/images/contact-page-design.png "Contact Page Wire Frame")
- The contact page will have a contact form contained within a box.
- The background of the contact form itself will be a different colour to the rest of the page for contrast
- This design may differ from the finished project, as an alternative to having the icons for separate pages, having one icon to send the user back to the splash screen
- The box with text on the side will be a privacy policy as the user's data would be processed in order for them to contact Siana
- The hamburger button of the mobile view should take the user back to the home page/splash screen

![Photography Page Design](./assets/images/photography-page-design.png "Photography Page Wire Frame")

- The photography and character design pages will be organised into four columns
- The pictures will each have a caption underneath it, detailing information regarding the image
- The mobile view will have a 'slideshow' style gallery, where per button click going back and forward the caption and the image will change.
